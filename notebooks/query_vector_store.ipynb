The RoBERTa implementation leverages the HuggingFace ecosystem to tokenize input text, generate embeddings, and compute probability distributions across sentiment classes. The analysis was conducted on a substantial dataset of approximately 500,000 Amazon food reviews, with comprehensive exploratory data analysis visualizations comparing model performance across different rating scales to validate prediction accuracy. The results demonstrate that the transformer-based approach provides superior performance over the lexicon-based approach.\n",

      "The project implements a sophisticated data transformation pipeline that processes raw CSV data with custom cleaning logic, including comma removal, numeric type conversion, and categorical renaming to prepare data for analysis. It systematically evaluates multiple visualization strategies: grouped bar charts are tested for their ability to compare categories within groups, but are shown to become cluttered with many categories; bubble charts are then introduced as an alternative where size adds a visual dimension to enhance magnitude differentiation. The implementation further demonstrates advanced color theory application by comparing diverging color scales (RdBu, balance) against sequential scales (Reds) on identical bubble chart datasets, revealing how red-to-blue transitions create cognitive friction due to counterintuitive color-value associations, while red-based sequential scales combined with bubble size provide faster visual comprehension. Each visualization is professionally styled with consistent grid lines and optimized layouts to isolate design variable impacts.\n",

      "## Result/Impact\n",
      "The project provides empirical, visual evidence for selecting appropriate chart types and color palettes based on data complexity and cognitive load considerations.

      "\n",
      "## Purpose\n",
      "Analyzes the economic gap between British Columbia's minimum wage and living wage to highlight the challenge faced by minimum wage workers. This project uses strategic data visualization to communicate a critical social and economic issue affecting workers in BC.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tech Stack\n",
      "Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Highlights\n",
      "Implements a slope chart visualization technique—a sophisticated data storytelling approach that effectively communicates the magnitude of wage disparity between two data points. The project demonstrates advanced matplotlib customization including custom axis formatters, multi-layer point plotting, strategic color palette selection, and high-resolution image export at 300 DPI. The visualization employs professional design principles such as visual hierarchy through point sizing, color differentiation to distinguish wage types, and supporting reference lines to enhance comparative analysis. Shows expertise in data manipulation using Pandas and NumPy for structured data preparation, combined with production-ready code practices that balance aesthetic appeal with analytical clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Skills Demonstrated\n",
      "Advanced data visualization design and narrative communication, with proficiency in translating numerical data into compelling visual stories. Demonstrates expertise in choosing appropriate visualization types for specific analytical goals, implementing professional chart styling, and optimizing visual design for clarity and impact. Strong capability in creating data-driven narratives that communicate complex economic information to diverse audiences while maintaining analytical rigor.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Result/Impact\n",
      "Quantified the wage gap at $9.20 CAD per hour, representing a 51% shortfall where living wage exceeds minimum wage. Generated a professional, publication-quality slope chart visualization that effectively illustrates economic disparity and serves as a powerful communication tool for stakeholder engagement and data-driven discourse.\n",
