    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the **dual-collection architecture** with **simplified personality chunking**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Changed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before (Section-Aware Chunking for Personality):**\n",
    "- Personality collection used regex to identify sections (Personality Traits, Career Preferences, Strengths)\n",
    "- Complex metadata with `section_type`, `section_name`, `traits_included`\n",
    "- Required header parsing and section-based grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "**After (Simple Fixed-Size Chunking):**\n",
    "- Personality collection uses simple 400-character chunks with 100-character overlap\n",
    "- No header identification or section parsing\n",
    "- Minimal metadata: `chunk_index`, `char_start`, `char_end`, `overlap_chars`\n",
    "- No `section_type` field (empty string for personality chunks)\n",
    "- No `traits_included` metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collection Structure**: Viewing BOTH collections with separate document counts\n",
    "2. **Resume Data Queries**: Querying `resume_data` for work experience, education, skills with full metadata\n",
    "3. **Personality Data Queries**: Querying `personality` collection with simplified fixed-size chunking\n",
    "4. **Embeddings**: Inspecting 1536-dimensional vectors and their statistics\n",
    "5. **Semantic Search**: Using OpenAI embeddings for similarity-based retrieval from specific collections\n",
    "6. **Section Filtering**: Combining semantic search with metadata filters within resume collection\n",
    "7. **Complete RAG Flow**: End-to-end retrieval → augmentation → generation workflow using both collections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Semantic separation**: Resume facts vs personality traits stored independently\n",
    "- ✅ **Simplified storage**: Personality collection doesn't require complex section metadata\n",
    "- ✅ **No cross-contamination**: Personality searches retrieve only personality data\n",
    "- ✅ **Faster queries**: Smaller, focused collections = faster semantic search\n",
    "- ✅ **Cleaner code**: No complex section_type filtering or header parsing logic\n",
    "- ✅ **Better relevance**: Semantic matching within focused collections yields better results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunking preserves context**: Each 400-char chunk maintains semantic meaning through overlap\n",
    "- **Embeddings enable semantic matching**: Query \"analytical thinking\" matches related personality traits\n",
    "- **Collection isolation prevents noise**: Searching personality collection won't return work achievements\n",
    "- **Metadata enables filtering**: Can retrieve specific section types within resume collection\n",
    "- **Similarity scores guide selection**: Higher scores = more relevant to query\n",
    "- **Simplified approach still works**: Fixed-size chunking is sufficient for personality content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run cells to explore your actual dual-collection vector database\n",
    "- Compare query results between collections\n",
    "- Modify queries to test different job requirements\n",
    "- Experiment with `score_threshold` values\n",
    "- Try combining multiple filters within each collection"
