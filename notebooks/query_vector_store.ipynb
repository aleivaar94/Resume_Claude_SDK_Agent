    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collection Structure**: Viewing all collections, document counts, and section types\n",
    "2. **Resume Data Queries**: Filtering work experience, education, skills with full metadata\n",
    "3. **Personality Data Queries**: Viewing personality, strength, and weakness chunks\n",
    "4. **Embeddings**: Inspecting 1536-dimensional vectors and their statistics\n",
    "5. **Semantic Search**: Using OpenAI embeddings for similarity-based retrieval\n",
    "6. **Section Filtering**: Combining semantic search with metadata filters\n",
    "7. **Complete RAG Flow**: End-to-end retrieval → augmentation → generation workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunking preserves context**: Each chunk contains a complete semantic unit (achievement, trait, skill)\n",
    "- **Embeddings enable semantic matching**: Query \"machine learning\" matches \"ML model\", \"predictive analytics\"\n",
    "- **Metadata enables filtering**: Can retrieve only work experience, only strengths, etc.\n",
    "- **Similarity scores guide selection**: Higher scores = more relevant to query\n",
    "- **Weaknesses are excluded**: `retrieve_personality_traits()` filters out `section_type='weakness'`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run cells to explore your actual vector database\n",
    "- Modify queries to test different job requirements\n",
    "- Experiment with `score_threshold` values\n",
    "- Try combining multiple filters (e.g., company + section_type)"
