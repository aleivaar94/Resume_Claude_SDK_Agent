    "This notebook demonstrates detailed querying of the Qdrant vector store with **triple-collection architecture**:\n",
    "- **`resume_data` collection** (from `resume_ale.md`): work experience, education, skills, continuing studies, personal info\n",

    "- **`projects` collection** (from `portfolio_projects.md`): portfolio projects with hierarchical chunking\n",

    "**Architecture Benefits:**\n",
    "- Semantic separation of resume facts, personality traits, and portfolio projects\n",

      "This project programmatically extracts product data from an e‑commerce API to build a clean, queryable dataset for analysis and downstream tooling. It demonstrates a repeatable ETL workflow to turn paginated JSON API results into analytics-ready CSV and relational data.\n",
      "\n",

      "Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, requests, numpy, json, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, Postman (for request prototyping), and Git.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Highlights\n",
      "The solution identifies the vendor API via browser developer tools, converts the API response into structured data, and implements pagination by incrementing the API skip/take parameters to reliably iterate through results. JSON responses are normalized into tabular form using pandas' json_normalize, followed by targeted cleaning and column transformations to parse price and unit fields. The cleaned dataframe is exported to CSV and persisted into a SQLite relational table with explicit column types via SQLAlchemy for easy querying and integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Skills Demonstrated\n",
      "Practical skills include API-driven data extraction, ETL design, JSON normalization, data cleaning and transformation, relational schema creation, and reproducible analysis in a notebook environment. It also demonstrates use of tooling for API inspection and request generation (Postman) and basic database engineering for analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Result/Impact\n",
      "The pipeline extracted and consolidated 1,519 meat-related product records into a CSV and a SQLite database, enabling efficient SQL queries and downstream analysis. This reproducible workflow reduces manual scraping effort and provides a reliable foundation for price analysis, category insights, and inventory-style analytics.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the **triple-collection architecture** with comprehensive querying patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collections Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`resume_data`**: Work experience, education, skills, continuing studies, personal info\n",
    "2. **`personality`**: Personality traits with fixed-size chunking (400 chars, 100 overlap)\n",
    "3. **`projects`**: Portfolio projects with hierarchical chunking (technical summaries + full content)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resume Collection\n",
    "- Section-based chunking with rich metadata (company, position, dates)\n",
    "- Filtered queries by section_type (work_experience, education, skills)\n",
    "- Semantic search for relevant achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Personality Collection\n",
    "- Simplified fixed-size chunking without complex section parsing\n",
    "- Direct semantic search without filtering\n",
    "- Efficient retrieval of matching traits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Projects Collection (NEW)\n",
    "- **Hierarchical chunking**: Each project has 2 chunks\n",
    "  - `project_technical`: Tech Stack + Technical Highlights (fast matching)\n",
    "  - `project_full`: Complete project with all sections (detailed context)\n",
    "- **Metadata-based retrieval**: Query by `project_id` to get specific projects\n",
    "- **Two-phase workflow**:\n",
    "  1. Search technical summaries for matches\n",
    "  2. Retrieve full content using project_ids\n",
    "- **Benefits**:\n",
    "  - Fast filtering by technology stack\n",
    "  - Efficient token usage (only embed full content when needed)\n",
    "  - Clear separation of filtering vs. detailed context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Patterns Explored\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collection structure inspection**: View document counts and section types\n",
    "2. **Filtered scrolling**: Retrieve documents by section_type or metadata\n",
    "3. **Semantic search**: Find similar content using embeddings\n",
    "4. **Combined filters**: Semantic search + metadata filtering\n",
    "5. **Metadata queries**: Exact match on specific fields (e.g., project_id)\n",
    "6. **Multi-phase retrieval**: Search summaries → retrieve full content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Semantic separation**: Resume, projects, and personality data stored independently\n",
    "- ✅ **Hierarchical retrieval**: Fast matching → detailed context (projects)\n",
    "- ✅ **No cross-contamination**: Queries return only relevant collection data\n",
    "- ✅ **Faster searches**: Smaller, focused collections improve performance\n",
    "- ✅ **Flexible workflows**: Different retrieval patterns per collection\n",
    "- ✅ **Efficient tokens**: Don't embed full project content for initial search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resume generation**: Retrieve relevant work achievements + matching projects + personality traits\n",
    "- **Cover letter**: Search all collections for job-specific content\n",
    "- **Portfolio showcase**: Find projects by technology stack or technical requirements\n",
    "- **Skills matching**: Semantic search across resume, projects, and personality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run cells to explore your actual triple-collection database\n",
    "- Experiment with different query combinations\n",
    "- Test hierarchical project retrieval workflow\n",
    "- Try metadata-based queries for specific projects\n",
    "- Combine results from multiple collections for complete RAG workflows"
